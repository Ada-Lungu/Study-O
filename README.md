# Study-O

Study-O is a project developed for the Web Security course, which focuses on
implementing best practices of security strategies for a web application.

The strategies used incorporate security measurements against most common types
of attacks, such as XSS (Cross-site Scripting), SQL injections, Brute-force Attacks.
The solutions include using a secured encrypted communication, secured authentication and
session managemnet, user input validation and sanitization, and other overall security approaches.

Study-O is a communication platform for students and professors. The application supports
the creation of shared workspaces, managed by an administrator(professor) and accesed by numerous users.
The administrator has control and grants access to who can join the workspace. Users can participate with 
content and input to the commonly shared workspace.
